        <h3>Ola! My name is Faiq IRL (big read ahead)</h3>
        <p>I'm 16, turning 17 this August (1st August) - I expect cake, gifts, and maybe a new gaming console!</p>
        <p><strong>Pronouns:</strong> He/Him...because "Optimus Primus" was already taken (bummer).</p>
        <p><strong>Likes:</strong> FORMULA 1 (Red Bull), computers, programming, gaming (both modern and retro), music, playing instruments, literature, touching grass (yes, it's real!), and plotting world domination (all in good fun, of course).</p>
        <p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> Slow internet (the ultimate rage-quit trigger), pineapple on pizza (don't @ me), and getting owned by NPCs in video games (seriously, how?).</p>
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I can write "Hello World" in over 10 programming languages, but I still can't remember where I left my keys...or my phone...or my mind sometimes.</p>
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Become a legendary programmer, start an epic retro gaming collection, and maybe, just maybe, figure out how to keep my plants alive (it's a work in progress).</p>
        <p><strong>Motto:</strong> "Why fit in when you were born to stand out?" - Dr. Seuss (and obviously, me).</p>
        <p><strong>Random Fact:</strong> I once spent an entire weekend binge-watching skibidi toilet sigma videos while eating way too many snacks. Gyatt!</p>
        <p><strong>Challenge for You:</strong> Decode this - "If you're feeling sigma while watching skibidi toilets and yelling gyatt at the screen, then you're definitely vibing on the next level."</p>
        <p><strong>Quirky Quirk:</strong> I have a superpower - I can procrastinate like a pro, especially when it comes to doing something constructive. Anyone else?</p>
        <p><strong>Gaming Achievements:</strong> I've defeated countless bosses, saved multiple universes, and still manage to get wrecked by Goombas in Mario. The struggle is real.</p>
        <p><strong>Music Taste:</strong> From Beethoven to Billie Eilish, my playlist is a chaotic mix of classical vibes and modern beats. Got any recommendations?</p>
        <p><strong>Future Dream:</strong> To create a game that combines all my favorite things - epic quests, mind-blowing music, and a hidden level where you just touch grass (because why not?).</p>
        <p><strong>Weird Hobby:</strong> Collecting random facts. Did you know honey never spoils? It might outlast my gaming addiction.</p>
